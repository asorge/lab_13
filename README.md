67-272 Lab 13 Starter Code
---

This is the starter code for the ajax lab, 'Lab 13: Improving My Town'.  Students will need to do `bundle install` to get necessary gems, run `rake db:migrate` to set up the database and add Pittsburgh to the system, and then run `rake test:units` to be sure all the unit tests are running properly.  Once that is done, run `rails server` to get the project running on localhost:3000.
